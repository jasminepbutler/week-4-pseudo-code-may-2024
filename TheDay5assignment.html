<p>Just a description of the socks example. 
    N+1 is used when there were no socks.
    The idea is that however many pairs 
    of sock you may have, if you pull 1 more 
    of that number(of half the socks)
    you will definitely have a pair.
    <br>
    In the example in the image.
    N 2-4 are listed to represent how many socks pulled.
    The number across from it represents how many socks
    need to be pulled to have a definite 1 pair.
